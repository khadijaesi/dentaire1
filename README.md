# Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Network for Intra-Oral Scanner Image Segmentation

## Prequisites
* python 3.7.4
* pytorch 1.4.0
* numpy 1.19.0
* plyfile 0.7.1

## Introduction
This work is the pytorch implementation of **TSGCN**, which has been published in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9594785/) and CVPR 2021 (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhang_TSGCNet_Discriminative_Geometric_Feature_Learning_With_Two-Stream_Graph_Convolutional_Network_CVPR_2021_paper.html).
#

## Usage
To train the TSGCN, please put the trainning data and testing data into data/train and data/test, respectively. Then, you can start to train a TSGCN model by following command.

```shell
python train.py
```
